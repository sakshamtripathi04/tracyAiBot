Telegram Bot on Render
This is a Python Telegram bot powered by Mistral AI, deployed on Render as a web service using a webhook.
Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
A Telegram account and a bot token from @BotFather
A Mistral AI account and API key from Mistral AI
A Render account (https://render.com)
A GitHub account

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-bot-render.git
cd telegram-bot-render


Install Dependencies:Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com

Replace your_telegram_bot_token, your_mistral_api_key, and https://your-render-service.onrender.com with your actual values.

Test Locally:Run the bot locally to ensure it works:
python app.py

Note: For local testing, you may need to use a tool like ngrok to expose your local server for the webhook.

Push to GitHub:Commit and push your changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main


Deploy on Render:

Log in to Render and create a new Web Service.
Connect your GitHub repository.
Set the following environment variables in Render's dashboard:
TELEGRAM_TOKEN: Your Telegram bot token
MISTRAL_API_KEY: Your Mistral API key
WEBHOOK_URL: Your Render service URL (e.g., https://your-service.onrender.com)
PYTHON_VERSION: 3.10.2 (or another compatible version)


Set the runtime to Python 3 and deploy.


Verify Webhook:After deployment, ensure the webhook is set by checking the logs in Render. The bot should respond to messages sent to it on Telegram.


Usage

Start a chat with your bot on Telegram using its username.
Use the /start command to initialize the bot.
Send any text message, and the bot will respond with a response from Mistral AI.

Troubleshooting

Check Render logs for errors if the bot doesn't respond.
Ensure environment variables are correctly set in Render.
Verify the webhook URL is accessible and correctly set with Telegram.
